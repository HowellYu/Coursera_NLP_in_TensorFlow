## Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow
DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate - Course 3
- **Week 1**: Sentiment in text
  - Tokenizer
    - OOV (out-of-vocab)
  - Padding
    - Post (after)
    - Truncating
  - Text to Seq
- **Week 2**: Word Embeddings
  - Embedding
  - WE Visualization Dashboard: http://projector.tensorflow.org/
  - Hyperparameter tuning
  - Splitting words into sub-tokens: case sensitive, punctuation kept
    - Not working well with ffnn
- **Week 3**: Sequence models
  - Bi-LSTM
  - Multiple Layer Bi-LSTM
  - CNN
  - Sarcasm with Bidirectional LSTM
  - Sarcasm with 1D Convolutional Layer
  - Overfitting: the model tends to overfit the training data since there might be OOV words in the validation data
- **Week 4**: Sequence models and literature
  - Text generation
  - (Optional): text generation on character level
